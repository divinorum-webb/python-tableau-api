This repository aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of leveraging the Tableau Server REST API to interact with Tableau Server using Python.
This serves as an alternative to the Tableau Server Client library. This library strives to provide one-to-one functionality mirroring the functions seen in the Tableau Server REST API documentation. A user can call upon this library using the same function names they see in the REST API documentation.
By contrast, when using the Tableau Server Client library, the methods used by that library do not match the naming conventions observed in the REST API documentation.

For example:
<pick a few REST API documentation methods>
<show how those methods are called upon using this library>
<show how those methods are called upon using the TSC library>
